# Digital Logic Design with Transaction Level Verilog

For the initial simulation and design, the Makerchip IDE is used. Detailed explanations and guidance on using the IDE can be found here in this [Link](https://www.makerchip.com/sandbox/#). Note that the Makerchip IDE platform does not recognize `TAB` for indentation; instead, use three spaces for indentation. `CTRL + ]` is used to indent the code to the right, and `CTRL + [` is used to indent the code to the left. Also, note that in TL-Verilog, using `*reset` refers to SystemVerilog code defined in macros.
